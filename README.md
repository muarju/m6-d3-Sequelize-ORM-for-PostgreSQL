# Shopping Cart API 
Building APIs for the Shopping cart application in Sequelize

In this "step" the application should enable the creation, editing, deletion, listing of categories using Sequelize

## Category
Cetegory should contain following information:
```
{
	    "id": 1,
	    "name": "ARTICLE CATEGORY",
      
}
```

## Routes
- GET /category => returns the list of categories with product
- GET /category /123 => returns a single category with product
- POST /category => create a new category
- PUT /category /123 => edit the category with the given id
- DELETE /category /123 => delete the category with the given id

## Product 
```
{
	    "id": 1,
	    "name": "name",
	    "categoryId": 1, //foreign key to Category
	    "image":"url(IMAGE LINK)",
	    "createdAt": "DATE",
	    "updatedAt": "DATE",   
}
```

## Routes

- GET /product => returns the list of product including the category
- GET /product /123 => returns a single product  including the category
- POST /product => create a new product
- PUT /product /123 => edit the product 
- DELETE /product /123 => delete the product with the given id

The persistence must be granted via Postgres
